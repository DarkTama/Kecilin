<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Cut a release: tag the current commit as v<version> and push, which
  triggers the GitHub Actions release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml).

  The version is read from src-tauri/tauri.conf.json - the single source of
  truth (it's what the app reports and what CI bundles).

  Usage: npm run release

  NOTE: keep this file ASCII-only. Windows PowerShell 5.1 parses BOM-less
  .ps1 files as ANSI, so UTF-8 punctuation breaks the script.
